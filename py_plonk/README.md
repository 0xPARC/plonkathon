# Py_plonk

Py_plonk is a simple python implementation of the PLONK protocol as described in https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf, targeted to be close to compatible with the implementation at https://zkrepl.dev. Py_plonk includes:

* A simple programming language for describing circuits, which it can compile into the forms needed for a PLONK proof (QL, QR, QM, QO, QC, S1, S2, S3 polynomials)
* A prover that can generate proofs for this language, given a list of variable assignments
* A verifier that can verify these proofs

Full compatibility is achieved in some cases: for simple programs, py_plonk is capable of outputting verification keys that _exactly_ match https://zkrepl.dev output. See the tests in test.py for some examples.

Many circom features are missing. The parts of PLONK that are responsible for ensuring strong privacy are left out (they are easy to add, they would simply increase complexity and reduce the educational value of this implementation).

This implementation is intended for educational use, and to help reproduce and verify verification keys that are generated by other software. IT HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED AND PROBABLY HAS BUGS, DO NOT USE BY ITSELF IN PRODUCTION.
