\TODO{Put the full description/definition of conflicting blocks here.}




\section{Unused text}

\todo{This is where text goes that for which a home hasn't been found yet.  If no home is found, it will be deleted.}

Two other reasons to participate in stake pools are (i) to mitigate \emph{key theft risk} (i.e. an attacker hacking into their online machine and stealing the key), and (ii) to mitigate \emph{liveness risk}, the possibility that the validator node will go offline, perhaps because the operator does not have the time to manage a high-uptime setup.


\todo{Do we want to require that the Prepare be done in the first 1/2 of the epoch?  I'm mildly concerned there may not always be enough time to Commit.}

\todo{Remember: The only block you're allowed to Prepare is the last block of each epoch.}

\todo{Remember: Even if the Finalization goes through, the collective penalties are still applied.}


\textbf{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item It's unclear to me why we need $\epochsource$ in the Prepare.
